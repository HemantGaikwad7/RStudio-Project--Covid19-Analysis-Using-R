COVID-19 Analysis Using R

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to explore demographic and clinical characteristics, with a particular focus on age and gender-related differences in mortality rates. The data is sourced from a public GitHub repository and is analyzed using R and RStudio. Key statistical methods, such as t-tests, are used to determine the significance of observed differences.

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available on GitHub:

URL: [COVID-19 Line List Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemantGaikwad7/RStudio-Project--Covid19-Analysis-Using-R/main/COVID19_line_list_data.csv")

Project Structure

Loading and Preparing the Data

Import necessary libraries (Hmisc for data description).
Load the dataset directly from the provided URL.
Inspect the dataset using the describe() function to understand its structure and content.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Creation of a binary death_dummy column to indicate if a patient died (1) or survived (0).
Calculation of the overall death rate.
Age Analysis

Hypothesis: People who die from COVID-19 are generally older.
Subsetting the data into dead and alive groups.
Calculation and comparison of the mean ages in these groups.
Statistical testing using a t-test to evaluate the significance of age differences.
Gender Analysis

Hypothesis: Gender has no effect on the COVID-19 mortality rate.
Subsetting the data into men and women groups.
Calculation of mortality rates for men and women.
Statistical testing using a t-test to determine if gender differences in mortality rates are significant.
Key Findings
Death Rate: The overall death rate in the dataset is approximately 5.81%.
Age and Mortality: There is a significant difference in the mean age of those who died (68.59 years) compared to those who survived (48.07 years). The difference is statistically significant with a p-value < 0.001, suggesting that older individuals are more likely to die from COVID-19.
Gender and Mortality: Men have a higher mortality rate (8.5%) compared to women (3.7%). This difference is statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05, indicating that gender may influence the likelihood of death from COVID-19.
Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of age and gender on COVID-19 outcomes. The findings are consistent with global observations that older adults and men are at higher risk of severe outcomes and mortality from COVID-19.
